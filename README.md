## Overview
I love books, have since I was very small. They have been a source of comfort and exploration for me all my life. This app is an expression of my joy for reading. It allows users to search for books via google's free books api, and then save all the books they've ever read to their user library. Users can make comments about the books in their library and see coments from other users who have checked out the same book. Also, in the user profile users can set reading goals which are dynamically updated as they update the progress of each book by setting the status of the book to 'unread', 'in-progress' or 'finished'. Users can also filter their personal library by category, rating, or number of pages, as well as search for books by typing the title in the user library serach bar. Once logged in, simply search for books and click the ones you'd like to add. Then edit details of each book by clicking on the book. Use the navbar 'actions' dropdown to set reading goals and update the user bio.
